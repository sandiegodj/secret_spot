secret_spot
===========
This is my final project for Harvard's CS50x course.


Plans for the future include:

1. Refactor using rails
2. Allowing users to form groups and share their data amongst themselves.
3. Utilize Google maps api to drop pins on your particular surf spot and base bouy on pin coordinates.
4. Flexible display table that lets you shuffle your data based on rating, swell direction, tide etc. 
5. When viewing data for a particular spot, have the current bouy and tide readings flashed in the header.
6. Allow viewing of every spots data in the same table, which can then be narrowed down per #4.
