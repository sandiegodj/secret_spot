secret_spot
===========
This is my final project for Harvard's CS50x course.

The app acts a "journal" of sort for the hardcore surfer who might keep a pen and paper journal of spot info, swell direction, interval ect.

One day you might be looking at the surf forecast and see that a nice 301 degrees NW swell at 20 s is coming in.  Just reference your data to see which spot breaks the best given these conditions and enjoy your surf.  


Plans for the future include:

1. Refactor using rails
2. Allowing users to form groups and share their data amongst themselves.
3. Utilize Google maps api to drop pins on your particular surf spot and base bouy on pin coordinates.
4. Flexible display table that lets you shuffle your data based on rating, swell direction, tide etc. 
5. When viewing data for a particular spot, have the current bouy and tide readings flashed in the header.
6. Allow viewing of every spots data in the same table, which can then be narrowed down per #4.
