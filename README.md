secret_spot
===========
This is my final project for the Harvardx CS50x course.  
It allows surfers to travel to their local surf spot and rate the current surf conditions.
These rating are then stored alongside the current buoy, tide and wind readings.
Surfer can then view current bouys and tide info and have a better predictor of which spot to drive to, saving gas and creating a better world for out children.

Data is currently kept private for each user in order to keep your secret spot secret.  

Plans for the future include:

1. Refactor using rails
2. Allowing users to form groups and share their data amongst themselves.
3. Utilize Google maps api to drop pins on your particular surf spot and base bouy on pin location.
4. Flexible display table that lets you shuffle your data based on rating, swell direction, tide etc.
